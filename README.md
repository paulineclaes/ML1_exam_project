# MachineLearning1
Repository for Machine Learning 1 project paper. Contains: data (csv-file), README, paper, JupyterNotebook.

There are some paragraphs of the paper that are included in this notebook, when they are useful as an extra explanation to the code that we are using, or the results section for example. However, as the paper is quite long, I did not want to submit a notebook with more text than code. Therefore I want to ask you to still look at and read the paper, which has more explanation and information than this notebook.
